    - title: OpenStreetMap US & TeachOSM
      description: >
        This session will include an introduction to editing in OpenStreetMap (the free, editable map of the whole world) followed by a mapathon.<br/><br/>
        Participants will gain a basic understanding of adding data to OpenStreetMap and then we will map part of the world together using the Tasking Manager. This session is open to mappers of all skill levels! No cost to join, but there is a suggested donation to OpenStreetMap US, the nonprofit that supports the OSM community in the US.

  sessions:
    - title: Data Visualization and Cartography with QGIS
      description: "This workshop will explore the wide range of data visualization and cartographic options available in QGIS 3. QGIS has seen remarkable growth in it's cartogrpahic capacities in recent years. You will learn many techniques unique to QGIS such as: use of inverted polygon shapeburst fills, blending modes, live layer effects and geometry generator symbol layers. We will also work with animating time based data, 3D views and Mesh data. If you want to take your map creation skills to the next level - this is the perfect workshop for you!"
      instructor: Kurt Menke, Bird's Eye View GIS
    - title: pg_tileserv, pg_featureserv, and AMA with Paul Ramsey
      description: >
        9:00-12:00 - Introductions to PostGIS<br/>
        1:00-2:30 - pg_tileserv and pg_featureserv<br/>
        2:45-4:00 - AMA with Paul Ramsey<br/>
        <br/>
        This session is an introduction and overview of two new open source spatial services they released, pg_tileserv and pg_featureserv. These two new microservices make PostGIS more available for developers to easily integrate their spatial data in PostGIS into web based spatial applications.<br/>
        <br/>
        Join Crunchy Data Executive Geospatial Engineer and founding contributor of PostGIS for an "Ask Me Anything" style session where attendees can ask Paul questions regarding PostGIS, Spatial data, and other spatial use cases. Attendees are encouraged to submit questions ahead of time so they can be grouped and addressed in an efficient manner. Attendees will be able to ask questions in real-time as well.
      instructor: Paul Ramsey &amp Crunchy Data Staff
    - title: Solving Environmental Challenges with Open Data and Human-Centered Design
      description: >
        The Opportunity Project (TOP) is an innovation program based out of the U.S. Census Bureau that brings
        together technologists, government, and communities to create digital products that tackle public-facing challenges
        using federal open data. To date, over 100 digital products have been created addressing challenges related to
        the opioid crisis, youth and veterans homelessness, entrepreneurship, education, geospatial data, and many others.
        <br/><br/>
        This year, sprints will focus on challenges related to the built and natural environments, including themes
        like air quality, rural economic development, reducing plastic waste, recycling, economic mobility, assisting refugees,
        and more. 
        <br/><br/>
        Join us for an exciting panel of technologists and federal agencies that have participated in the TOP process! Panelists will share their experiences, lessons learned, and methods of open collaboration to tackle challenges felt by communities around the country. Shortly after, join us for a master class in human-centered design, a revolutionary methodology for understanding people's needs, and building effective solutions. This session will teach participants new and different tools for problem framing, qualitative user research, idea generation, prototyping, and visual thinking.

    - title: "Using STAC and Open-Source Tools with Sentinel-2 data"
      description: >
        Sentinel-2 atmospherically corrected (Level 2) data was recently generated for all of Africa and going back at least 3 years for the Digital Earth Africa project. However, this data has been stored in a Requester Pays bucket on AWS S3 in JPEG2K format which has limited some uses. Element 84 is working with Geoscience Australia to convert this data to Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF, generating metadata in the new SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC). The data itself is free and open to anyone, and is easily discoverable via the STAC API.
        <br/><br/>
        In this short tutorial we will look at the STAC metadata, the format of the data files themselves, and will demonstrate how to use some Open-source tools such as sat-search to query the STAC API and find data of interest. We will also discuss the ecosystem of Open-Source tools that can be used with STAC for downloading raw files, reading windows of the data directly, and tiling scenes dynamically via Lambda functions.
