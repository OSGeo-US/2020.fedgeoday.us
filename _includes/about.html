                <h3 class="section-subheading-alt1 text-muted">For decades open source software has been at the
                    forefront of innovation in data collection, analysis, and visualization. Today, open source
                    geospatial software has evolved into an "open ecosystem" of software, communities, and companies
                    that enable field data collection and advanced visualization and lead the way in drone, lidar, IOT,
                    and satellite imagery collection and analysis.</h3>
                <h3 class="section-subheading-alt1 text-muted">When open source software is combined with open
                    standards
                    for interoperability, government agencies have the
                    most scalable, stable, secure and cost effective tools available to support activities including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Empowering disadvantaged communities with limited funding</li>
                        <li>Enabling real-time data analysis at planetary scale</li>
                        <li>Optimizing release schedules for constituent facing tools</li>
                    </ul>
                </h3>
                <h3 class="section-subheading-alt1 text-muted">Join us for this one day conference in the heart of
                    Washington DC. The morning plenaries will share
                    how open source geospatial tools have become a critical part of operations within multiple federal
                    agencies. The afternoon break out sessions will tackle technical and management solution use cases.

                    tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
                    appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online
                    media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
                    conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</h3>

                    Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use
                    sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
