Mark your calendars for **FedGeoDay 2019 in Washington D.C. on Thursday, January 31** and **sign up now at [FedGeo.US](https://fedgeo.us)**. Registration is only $25 for Federal, NGO and Academic attendees.

The purpose of FedGeoDay is to promote and grow the Open Ecosystem within the Federal Agency Community. There is no proprietary software or data company growing this ecosystem. We in and of these communities have to do it ourselves. Guido Stein (OSGeo.US/Applied Geographics) and Eddie Pickle (Radiant Solutions) are chairing the event and working with a great program committee including Tod Dabolt (US Dept of Interior), Bryan Lane (DNI), Joel Schlagel (USACE), Josh Campbell (ex State Dept/Sand Hill Geo), Anthony Calamito (Mapbox), and Marc Vloemans (LocationTech).

There will be **many participants from the Open Source Community contributing** to the program including people involved in Open Mapping, Data Science (AI/ML), Web Development, Open Data, Disaster Response & Resilience and Open Source Geospatial Software development. There will be **a great deal of Federal, NGO and Industry insight** from from speakers and panelists inclusing a **keynote from Carter Christopher of NGA** and panels lead by thought leaders from the Dept of Interior, DNI, In-Q-Tel, US Census Bureau, and Mapbox.

**Please pass along this information to your friends and colleagues today**. FedGeoDay is a unique event for the Open Source Geospatial Community in the DC area and a wonderful chance for you to network, get programmatic and technical ideas, and learn how to build and grow your programs and projects using Open Source Technologies.
