# Zoom Webinar as Main Stage

- invite panelists, moderators, and community organizers to attend as an attendee and then promote them in the transition
- do not use panelists invitation unless you expect everyeone to be there before the meeting starts
- when panel is over, make panelists atendees again
- have an mc co-host to do the talking as you go into and out of transitions
- have a host manage all the video/audio setup
- allow panelists to share their screens

# Zoom meeting breakout rooms for training

- only host can move people into rooms
- once assigned to a room, a atendee needs to be moved from within the room list, not from the participant window
- setup a slide letting people know what to expect
  - please be patient
  - facilitator will say your name and then you can unmute to help you get into a room
  - trust that people will tell you the right room, one person registering off of list will take forever
  - have people rename themselves to the room they want to enter, then rename to their name once in room
- have event brite open to help find registration if needed
- use chat if the mic isn't on for the attendee
- set agreed upon time to stop letting new people into the room (30 minutes)
  - but always make exceptions for people who fell out of the room
